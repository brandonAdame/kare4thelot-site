              Kare4TheLot was birthed during a time when the community / world was
              uncertain if normal would every be an option. We desire to be a
              piece of the non-profit world that seeks to genuinely help those
              that has consumed themselves with things to try to make sense of it
              all. Unfortunately, while trying to make sense of this life that we
              all face now some have forgotten self care, worth, and value.
