        At Kare4thelot, our mission is to serve our community with compassion
        and grace.
      </span>
      <p class="">
        We are guided by the words of <span class="verse">
          Matthew 25:36: "I was naked and you gave me clothing..."
        </span>. This scripture is the heart behind our newest initiative,
        KareFreeBoutique, is a free mobile clothing service designed to meet a
        tangible need while honoring the dignity of every individual.
      </p>
      <p class="">
        We believe that providing access to new and gently used clothing is more
        than just a physical act; it’s about restoring confidence and
        self-worth.
